# gas_pipeline_risk_model
Comprehensive Gas Pipeline Risk Assessment Model

This script implements a complete pipeline risk assessment workflow:
- loads economic, technical and probability datasets (Excel files)
- computes direct economic cost and technical cost
- computes a survival function and Shannon entropy for uncertainty weighting
- merges datasets and computes a final risk metric per Zone/Time
- generates a summary report and visualizations
- saves the final detailed results to an Excel file and exports plots
